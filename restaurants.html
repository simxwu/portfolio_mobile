            This page has resturant suggestions for the Greater Boston Area. Here are some good resturant to try if you are around the area.
            When you think of Boston's restaurant scene, you probably think of seafood: lobster rolls, clam chowder, crab cakes or old favorites like baked beans and Boston cream pie. Sure, traditional comfort food has its rightful place in our hearts and appetites. But let's be honest - Boston's modern cuisine is far more eclectic. Just like our 23 neighborhoods are culturally diverse, our restaurants are equally distinct, and that's what makes dining in Boston such a unique and pleasurable experience.

From hot pot, dumplings and noodles in the nation's third-largest Chinatown to soul-warming Italian plates in the North End, Boston's restaurant scene truly brings something to the table for everyone.
